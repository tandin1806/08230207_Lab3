                <h3>Middle School â€“ Pemagatshel Middle Secondary School</h3>
                <p>Pemagatshel school was more than just a school for me, it was home 
                   from PP to class 10. It was here that my curiosity slowly turned
                   into a genuine love for learning. Each stage of my journey at Pemagatshel 
                   was filled with experiences. Looking back, I realize how every lesson, 
                   every friend, and every teacherâ€™s guidance hepled me turn to the person
                   I am becoming today.</p>

                <p>The school where students discover themselves and emphasizing academic excellence, 
                   while also nurturing creativity and teamwork through cultural programs, sports, and 
                   community service. High school life at Nangkor Central School was a mix of joy and 
                   responsibility, cheering classmates on sports days, preparing nervously for class 
                   presentations, and laughter with friends during breaks. These moments, along with
                   teachersâ€™ encouragement and lasting friendships, remain cherished long until graduation.</p>
