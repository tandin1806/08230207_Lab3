                Hi! I'm Tandin Wangmo, someone who finds joy in simple and meaningful experiences. 
                I love immersing myself in anime for its creativity, emotion, and captivating stories, 
                and while I enjoy music, Iâ€™m not particularly skilled at it, but I love letting it set 
                the mood for my day. Iâ€™m not very outgoing, yet I appreciate genuine connections and quiet
                moments. Sleeping, cooking, and savoring delicious meals are some of my favorite ways to 
                recharge and express creativity. I also enjoy watching a wide range of films, from animations 
                to thrillers and horror, exploring nature through hiking, and satisfying my curiosity by learning 
                about the world around me. These passions make everyday life exciting, and I like embracing 
                each experience in my own calm and thoughtful way.
            </p>
